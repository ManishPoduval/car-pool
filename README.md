# Linear Car Pool 

> Ever having trouble figuring out the quickest way to pool cabs ?

Linear Car pool uses Google map's Distance API to figure out the best possible way to pool people of locations close to each other in one cab . 
Input a set of locations to pick up, number of cabs and the destination and you're done. Linear Cab Pool will do the rest for you. It'll pool people of similar/ close locations in one cab and even show the quickest road on the map to take. 


### Getting Started

###### Windows

 Clone the repository on your local machine
 
 `git clone https://github.com/ManishPoduval/car-pool.git`

Go to the ShortestPath folder

`cd ShortestPath`

Install the required packages via npm and yarn and build your project via grunt

`npm install`

`yarn install --module-folder=./components`

`grunt build`

Now just open the index.html file.

### Usage

Once you open the index.html file, this is the first view you'll see

You will get to see a map covering your entire screen

Enter your destination, your pick up/drop locations, number of cabs available.
You'll get the following image, with the markers populated accordingly. Your destination marker is in green and the rest are in yellow

Now to plot the routes on the map click on the Calculate button.
You'll get the routes plotted on the map as well as the locations marked with alphabets indicating the order of the pick up for each route.
