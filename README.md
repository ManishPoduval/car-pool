# Linear Car Pool 

> Ever having trouble figuring out the quickest way to pool cabs ?

Linear Car pool uses Google map's Distance API to figure out the best possible way to pool people of locations close to each other in one cab . 
Input a set of locations to pick up, number of cabs and the destination and you're done. Linear Cab Pool will do the rest for you. It'll pool people of similar/ close locations in one cab and even show the quickest road on the map to take.
